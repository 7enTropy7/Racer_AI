# Racer_AI

A 2D OpenAI Gym style environment that allows you to create custom racing tracks with checkpoints, and train a car to navigate through them. This environment can be used as a benchmark for various reinforcement learning algorithms and is compatible with Stable Baselines 3.

In this repo, we have trained a PPO agent using Stable Baselines 3 to navigate through various custom race tracks. We then utilized the trained expert agent to Further, we have also implemented
